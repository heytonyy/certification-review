     - with parameters
     - without parameters
     - with return values
     - without return values
     - default parameters

### Objective 3: Students will understand and implement functional decomposition.
(Breaking a program down into one or more functions.)
1. Identify repetitive or redundant code in an application
2. Understand the role abstraction plays in computer programming
3. Demonstrate how to abstract multiple steps into a function
4. Identify the characteristics of a well-defined function
   - Examples: shorter code, efficiency, reduced memory consumption, high reliability, readability, abstraction
